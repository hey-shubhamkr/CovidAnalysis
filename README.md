# Covid Analysis
This is a project which focuses on analysing the Infection rate in different countries and checking the effectiveness of Lockdown in the country.Infection Rate is the daily change in confirmed cases which will helps us to understand the pace of spread in any country.\
The chosen dataset updates regularly which keeps our visualization relevant everytime we run it.\
I am using plotly to visualise the data. Github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.\
